              UFC fighting is a high-intensity sport where skill, strength, and
              strategy converge to test athleticism at its peak.
            </p>
            <p>
              It combines diverse martial arts disciplines such as boxing,
              Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, wrestling, and Muay Thai, allowing fighters
              to showcase precision strikes, grappling techniques, and endurance
              in the octagon. Beyond physical prowess, UFC demands mental
              toughness and adaptability, as fighters continuously refine their
              strategies to counter evolving challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
              This sport also emphasizes respect for the athletes and the
              rigorous discipline required to compete at the highest level.

              <p>Role: President of UFC.</p>
              <p>
                Impact: Dana White has been the driving force behind the UFC’s
                rise to global prominence. He became UFC President in 2001 and
                has overseen its transformation from a niche combat sport into a
                worldwide entertainment powerhouse. White is known for his
                outspoken personality and is often considered the face of UFC.
                His leadership has been instrumental in securing major TV deals,
                expanding into new markets, and elevating UFC fighters to
                mainstream recognition.

                Impact: Nick Maynard, alongside Sean Shelby, plays an essential
                role in matchmaking for UFC events. His job involves analyzing
                fighters, their styles, and how matchups could generate
                excitement and make sense for UFC’s business. The matchmakers

                Impact: Sean Shelby is one of the key people responsible for
                creating the matchups in UFC events. Along with his colleague
                Nick Maynard, Shelby is responsible for identifying potential
                fights and pairing fighters in a way that makes sense for both
                competitive and business reasons. His job requires a deep
                understanding of each fighter's skills, rankings, and the
                promotion’s strategic direction.

              <p>Role: Former Majority Owners of UFC.</p>
              <p>
                The Fertitta brothers were the primary owners of UFC until
                selling it to Endeavor in 2016. Lorenzo served as Chairman and
                CEO, while Frank managed Station Casinos. They played a key role
                in UFC's rise by securing TV deals, expanding the brand, and
                growing its global presence. Their sale to Endeavor marked a
                major shift, but their contributions to UFC's success are
                lasting.
