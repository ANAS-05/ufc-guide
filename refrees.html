            <h2>Herb Dean</h2>
            <p>
              Herb Dean made his debut as a UFC referee in 2004, having competed
              as a mixed martial artist previously. In his long and illustrious
              career, Dean has refereed some of the UFC's most iconic matches
              right from Tim Sylvia vs. Frank Mir, where he stopped the fight on
              noticing Sylvia's forearm snapping, to saving Mirko Cro Cop's leg
              from serious injury during the Mirko Cro Cop vs. Gabriel Gonzaga
              fight.
            </p>
            <p>
              Owing to Dean's work as a referee Dana White was quoted saying "is
              one of the best referees in this business. Actually, I think he's
              the best".

              MMA/refereeing background Smith is one of the few UFC referees to
              have attained great success as a referee in a relatively small
              amount of time.
